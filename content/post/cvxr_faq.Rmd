## Answers

1. <a name="help"></a>Where can I go for help?

Please use the [Stackoverflow `cvx`
forum](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cvx) for posting
questions.

2. <a name="dcp-help"></a>My problem is not DCP compliant? Help!

Your best bet is the reference @BoydVandenberghe:2004 book. It is just
not possible for us to analyze every individual problem and determine
how to reformulate it in DCP form.

3. <a name="bug"></a>I want to report a bug.

Please open an issue on [Github
Issues](https://github.com/anqif/CVXR/issues) and include a
reproducible example.
