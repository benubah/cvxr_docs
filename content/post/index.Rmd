## What is `cvxr`?

`cvxr` is an R package that provides an object-oriented modeling
language for convex optimization, similar to `CVX`, `CVXPY`, `YALMIP`,
and `Convex.jl`. It allows the user to formulate convex optimization
problems in a natural mathematical syntax rather than the restrictive
standard form required by most solvers. The user specifies an
objective and set of constraints by combining constants, variables,
and parameters using a library of functions with known mathematical
properties. `cvxr` then applies signed disciplined convex programming
(DCP) to verify the problem’s convexity. Once verified, the problem is
converted into standard conic form using graph implementations and
passed to a cone solver such
as [ECOS](https://github.com/embotech/ecos) or 
[SCS](https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs).

## Status

Although `cvxr` continues to be developed
on [Github](https://github.com/anqif), the current release implements all of
the `CVXPY` atoms except for `geo_mean` and parameters. The latter is
not an impediment since any parameter can be replaced by a variable.

The focus of the development is mostly on speeding up the
canonicalization and construction of problem data in `cvxr`.

## Installing `cvxr`

`cvxr` is installed like any other R package
from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org).

## Documentation

A large set of examples, many ported from `CVXPY` are available in
the [Examples](/post/cvxr_examples/) section.

Paul K. Rosenfield for their contributions to the software’s
development. In particular, we are indebted to Steven Diamond for his
work on [CVXPY](http://www.cvxpy.org/en/latest/); most of `cvxr` code,
documentation, and examples were ported from his Python library.
