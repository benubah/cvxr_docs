What is <code>cvxr</code>?
</h2>
<p>
<code>cvxr</code> is an R package that provides an object-oriented modeling language for convex optimization, similar to <code>CVX</code>, <code>CVXPY</code>, <code>YALMIP</code>, and <code>Convex.jl</code>. It allows the user to formulate convex optimization problems in a natural mathematical syntax rather than the restrictive standard form required by most solvers. The user specifies an objective and set of constraints by combining constants, variables, and parameters using a library of functions with known mathematical properties. <code>cvxr</code> then applies signed disciplined convex programming (DCP) to verify the problem’s convexity. Once verified, the problem is converted into standard conic form using graph implementations and passed to a cone solver such as <a href="https://github.com/embotech/ecos">ECOS</a> or <a href="https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs">SCS</a>.

<p>
We are grateful to Steven Diamond, John Miller, and Paul K. Rosenfield for their contributions to the software’s development. In particular, we are indebted to Steven Diamond for his work on <a href="http://www.cvxpy.org/en/latest/">CVXPY</a>; most of <code>cvxr</code> code, documentation, and examples were ported from his Python library.
